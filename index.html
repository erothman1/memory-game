<!-- make the cards into buttons, have the content of the button be display none unless clicked on? -->
<!-- right answers will be determined based on if the content of the cards match or are equal? -->
<!-- use Fisher-Yates algorithm? to shuffle items, but need to prevent duplicates and stop the shuffling after a certain number of items have been picked  -->
<!-- if the dimensions are 4x4 and there are 16 boxes, we need to have 8 items(half of total boxes) chosen by the shuffle -->
<!-- when answers are correct, we can add a correct class to those cards and those cards won't be flipped back over?? -->
